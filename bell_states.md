What's the workflow here?

Going to do it for the singlet Bell state now.

Have to evaluate 64 different expectations. Start off by doing the first 16, and then proceed to the evolution by the channel. The first 16 are quite easy, but just need to see what the identity operator does. After the first 16, you will have branches of 4 at max. And at the very end, you can have even more. OK OK, very similar workflow to last time.
